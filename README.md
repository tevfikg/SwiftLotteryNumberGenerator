# Swift Lottery Number Generator

This project contains two Swift code examples that generate 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 49, and then arrange them in descending order. These examples can be useful for educational purposes in learning Swift programming or implementing a random number generator in applications.

## Features

- Generates 6 unique random numbers
- Number range: 1 to 49 (inclusive)
- Sorts the generated numbers in descending order
- Provides two different implementation approaches

## Code Examples
The project includes two Swift code examples:

- Example 1: Uses a while loop and a Set to generate unique numbers.
- Example 2: Uses the shuffle() method and array slicing for number generation.

## Usage
To use these examples:

Open a Swift playground or create a new Swift file in Xcode.
Copy and paste the desired example into your Swift environment.
Run the code to see the generated lottery numbers.

## Requirements

Swift 5.0 or later
Xcode 11.0 or later (if using Xcode)
